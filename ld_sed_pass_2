# ... and handle the extra ) that we introduce with this for the first case
#/cond/N;s/cond(.*\n.*)case\)\(/cond\1(/
/cond/N;s/cond\(.*\n.*\))(/cond\1(/

# which can be explained as:
# /cond/N  = find a line using the RE cond and append it to the pattern space with a \n
# s/.../ = then find a string in the pspace that starts with cond, has chars, then a newline, more chars etc,
#          and replace it with cond and the 1st collected chars.
# this has the net effect of replacing the first )(
